**Introduction**



<a name="br4"></a> 

React is an open source javascript library created by

:

Popular among developers and now widely used in

the software industry for Application development

and Web Development

React’s greatest advantage resides in it’s

performance and flexibility when using reusable

components

React also provides numerous functionalities to

develop complex applications

**How to Install React ?**

ꢀ



<a name="br6"></a> 

Pré-requis

And any of your favorite IDE ;)

**Install your first React App**

npx create-react-app name\_your\_app



<a name="br8"></a> 

**File Structure of the newly created React App**

**node\_modules : File containing external dependencies our project need to run correctly**

**public : Contains static files accessible from the browser when the app is compiled**

**src The file where we will write and keep the source code of our app**



<a name="br9"></a> 

**Launch the React App**

npm start



<a name="br10"></a> 

**Components**



<a name="br11"></a> 

A react component is a reusable component for the construction of User

Interface Components

These components are created by combining JavaScript, HTML and css.

Tw o ways to write it class based or functional

React components follow a hierarchical Approach

Parent components transmit props to their child components

The child elements can also have states which belong to them alone,

which are likely to change in time

**Difference between a class component**

**and functional component**



<a name="br15"></a> 

**(State & Props)**



<a name="br16"></a> 

State :

State is internal data for a component which can be modified and

change the component’s behaviour

The goal of state in React is to store and manage data for dynamic

components

When the state of a component change, React automatically updates the

UI to reflect those changes

(Props) :

Properties are values passed from a parent component to a child

component.

They allow us to transmit information and features from parent to child.

Props are not mutable, you cannot change it inside of the receiving

component
